# Win32-GDI-3D-Graphics
Attempt at a 3d graphics engine in win32 gdi

### Disclaimer: 
THIS IS NOT A LARGE PROJECT, and if you are looking for a complete, useable game engine or 3d renderer, this is not the place to be. If you are interested in making your own renderer, some of the maths here might be useful, however i would still recommend you look elsewhere, as i have no real experience here, and am using this project to try and gain some. Who knows, maybe this will serve a purpose at some point.

### Things that I would like to do at some point, in order of priority:
-Better ways to create and interact with objects<BR>
=>__Asteroids 3D Demo__<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Event Handling<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Hitscan hit detection<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2D HUD<BR>
-Backface culling<BR>
-depth based occlusion(ie z-buffer) - i intend to do with something similar to BSP<BR>
-Solid colour faces<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Textures<BR>
-Phong shading<BR>
=>__Basic 1V1 Arena FPS__<BR>
-Lighting<BR>
-Bump maps<BR>
-Working mirrors<BR>

These things will not happen for a while; this is purely a means of motivating myself
